# Vue Dictionary

This is my first attempt at using Vue. This app is a simple version of the [Dictionary web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL). 

A more complex version of this app was made with React:
- React Solution URL: [Github](https://github.com/jessabc/dictionary)
- React Live Site URL: [Dictionary app](https://dictionary-word.netlify.app)
